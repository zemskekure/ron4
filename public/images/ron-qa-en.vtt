00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440 line:75% position:50% align:center
Top song to cook.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.494 line:75% position:50% align:center
Oh, that changes.
Oh, my God.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.734 line:75% position:50% align:center
For me, that's a really hard
question because I love my music.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.400 line:75% position:50% align:center
You know what?

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.694 line:75% position:50% align:center
I'm going to look
at my playlist right now.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.520 line:75% position:50% align:center
I'll tell you the last
song that's been played.

00:00:09.586 --> 00:00:12.533 line:75% position:50% align:center
That's easy.
A song called Sunshine by Most Death.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.360 line:75% position:50% align:center
Which ingredient do you
think is the most underrated?

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:17.854 line:75% position:50% align:center
Unfortunately, I think salt.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:19.454 line:75% position:50% align:center
I think people don't use it properly.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680 line:75% position:50% align:center
When someone says Czech Republic, what's
the first thing that comes to their mind?

00:00:22.746 --> 00:00:24.160 line:75% position:50% align:center
Fear, right away.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.214 line:75% position:50% align:center
I only say that because I've been years
ago when I was, I think I was in my early

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.400 line:75% position:50% align:center
20s when I was there last time.
The only I was there.

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:32.720 line:75% position:50% align:center
And I remember the beer was unreal.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.640 line:75% position:50% align:center
I was also 20, and that was
what was on my high priorities.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.480 line:75% position:50% align:center
Also, you know what?

00:00:39.546 --> 00:00:42.054 line:75% position:50% align:center
I had one of the best meals
of my life ever in Prague.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.160 line:75% position:50% align:center
But when the food sat in front of me,
it was this big wooden block with a pork

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:48.894 line:75% position:50% align:center
knuckle with a knife sticking in it
and just a big thing, I think

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.560 line:75% position:50% align:center
horseradish or mustard on the side.
And that was it.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.000 line:75% position:50% align:center
Okay.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.880 line:75% position:50% align:center
And was the first thing that comes
to mind when someone says Canada?

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.334 line:75% position:50% align:center
Well, I mean, to me,
home and also cold because it's

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.414 line:75% position:50% align:center
snowing like crazy outside right now.
It's not warm.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.454 line:75% position:50% align:center
But Canada, to me, is home,
and it always will be.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:03.840 line:75% position:50% align:center
What are you bringing to Prat?

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.200 line:75% position:50% align:center
I think knowledge and enthusiasm with what
I do and what I'm able to show everyone.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.694 line:75% position:50% align:center
I'm super excited about it.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240 line:75% position:50% align:center
And what dish reminds
you of your childhood?

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.400 line:75% position:50% align:center
Oh, meatloaf.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.320 line:75% position:50% align:center
My mom's meatloaf.

00:01:17.386 --> 00:01:20.974 line:75% position:50% align:center
That sounds so stereotypical if you say
that to someone in North America,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.960 line:75% position:50% align:center
or more so probably a Sunday roast,
like Yorkshire puddings.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.240 line:75% position:50% align:center
Actually, yeah, let's say that.

00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:27.040 line:75% position:50% align:center
Yorkshire pudding and a Sunday roast.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280 line:75% position:50% align:center
My mom's.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.054 line:75% position:50% align:center
I still go home for that and want
that when I go home and see her.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.880 line:75% position:50% align:center
Am I over the camera?
All right, there you go.
